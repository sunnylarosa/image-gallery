Environment Variables
---------------------
Every JS application has access to global variable called "process". It is an object and inside
of it there was property called "env". This property holds all environment variables of the 
application.

The filename that we could actually use for storage of any variables that should not be
committed to git are:
	- .env.local
	- .env.development.local
	- .env.test.local
	- .env.production.local
React application will automatically look for those environment files and insert variables 
from them into process.env object.

Details about environment variables handling in React apps bootstrapped using create-react-app
find it in: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/
